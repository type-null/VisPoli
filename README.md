I see three “buckets” of data associations you may example examine 1: COVID, transportation, psychiatric 2: Policing/Stop and Frisk 3: Policing/Stop and Frisk and psychiatric


I will take  look into the transportation and part of stop and frisk data as we discussed yesterday. I had a class at 2, so I have to go. Thanks everyone.
